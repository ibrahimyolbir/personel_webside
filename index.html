              <h3>About me</h3>
              <p>Since 2007 I have worked in Software Training and Support Expert in Turkey. I was responsible for a system and worked out of it. During the period in the area and tasks I worked with, I have been working with the head of the Ministry of Health, Hospitals, Patients, and in direct contact with the people involved in the development of health and medical care systems. In this development, I have been a support for them and given a lot of support and have been a major assistant within the company. This company has also contributed significantly to the development of the health and medical care system in Turkey, where I have always been a part of these projects. </p>
